GET retrieves remote data and POST inserts or updates remote data.

A cookie is a text file that makes data (like pages you've visited, usernames, advertisement stuff) persistant. The internet doesn't remember that stuff so cookies are implemented to remember. Some people don't like them because ad companies will purchase them to feed you ads similar to the sites you've visited. HTTP requests can remember the requests and it helps give you the browser a better experience.
