To learn JQuery in two hours I plan to skim through and read some things in my JQuery book. I plan to search some things on the internet and possibly look into some codecademy lessons to get some basics down pretty quickly. 

Internet searches should help come with some stuff as well. Maybe I will read really top level stuff first like a wikipedia article on JQuery so I can get a more in depth summary of what it is? Maybe I'll skip that article. SO possibly has some good information. I'll make sure to look there. I'd really like to test some things and write some code. Maybe I'll watch a few youtube videos and see if there are any good tutorials.

It would be nice to test some of the things that I've learned. I'll look for some free tutorials online and see if they are worth perusing. I plan on working for about 30 minutes and then taking a 5 minute break so I don't feel like I over do it. 

I feel like I can learn a good amount if I tackle learning JQuery in this way. A variety of sources usually is helpful and I have a good variety that I've discussed in this plan.

Learning JQuery
----------------------------------------------
I started reading from my book JavaScript & JQuery. I read that for 30 minutes and I realized that I do want to learn everything. I even started reading some more JS stuff just to recap old things and learn new things. Then I got on track and started reading about JQuery. I'm glad I have my timer or else I would have spent several hours reading about JQuery, it's so interesting.

I took a break and went and ate dinner. I slowly got back into learning about JQuery after dinner and decided to try codecademy next. I went longer than 30 minutes probably 45 just because I loved what I was learning and it's easy to do the activities. But again I'm glad that I stopped and then took a break after codecademy. I could have finished working on the tutorials if I weren't trying to be conscientiouss of my time. 

Next I decided to come back from a 10 minute break and do a tutorial that I found that helps me to set up my JQuery in an HTML file. It helped me to determine what I need to do to set it up correctly and how it is I can manipulate things with JQuery. I knew I needed to download the JQuery file but I didn't know how to use it in the HTML code so that it would work. This tutorial found at 'http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/' is really helpful.

For the last 30 minutes I did some more of the tutorial that I found and messed around with some of my own ideas. I also went back to the codecademy tutorial to look at some things that I liked. I got a bit sidetracked messing around with code and the 30 minutes was quickly up. 

I feel like the tutorials from codecademy and learn.jquery.com were the most effective resources for me to quickly learn jQuery. I do like the book that I have. It has some great tips in it, but it was too hard for me to get it to sink in without actually doing some tutorials and getting some hands on experience.
