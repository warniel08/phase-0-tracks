<!-- HTML5 semantic tags are there to keep your webpage in order and make it readable for you and others who may be editing your code. They make it easier for styling as well when you add CSS. For the most useful, it depends on what I am doing to my website. I think main is a great one because it contains the main content of what you are doing and from there you can add more tags within the main tag. I also like header and footer to visually seperate the top and bottom of the page and what goes in there.

The order is read from top to bottom. The first elements are read first up to the last element. The order for external sources like images can vary and are harder to predict.

I learned the Sublime is very handy with creating snippets. Snippets are super helpful and save time. I think I may create more in the future, but I also like the ones that are default. I may tweak the main ones to add stuff that I commonly use.

The concept that is most difficult for me, and it's because I don't have a ton of experience, is just when to use the correct tag at the correct time. HTML5 is updated and I see a lot of code examples from previous HTML that has a lot of <div> tags and so I get lost with those. Just trying to simplify my code and to know when to use the correct tags is the challenge. I think with time and practice I can obviously improve.   -->
