# 6.4 Solo Challenge
# Warner Nielsen

# No matter what you design, your class must have:

# 1. at least three attributes (example: age) (using at least two data types) whose values will vary from instance to instance 
# at least three methods, at least one of which takes an argument
# You're welcome to be creative about these: a dress can have a swish method, a soccer ball can have an inflatedness attribute, and ... we hope it's obvious what a fire-breathing dragon can do, but if not, you'll figure it out.

# class that represents 7 dwarves called Dwarf
# it will contain the attributes of :age, :name, :working(boolean that states true or false if they are working or not)
# initialize each new Dwarf with these three attributes

# 3 methods:

# method_one(argument)
# => input:
# => steps:
# => output:

# method_two
# => input:
# => steps:
# => output:

# method_three
# => input:
# => steps:
# => output:
