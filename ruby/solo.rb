# 6.4 Solo Challenge
# Warner Nielsen

# No matter what you design, your class must have:

# at least three methods, at least one of which takes an argument
# You're welcome to be creative about these: a dress can have a swish method, a soccer ball can have an inflatedness attribute, and ... we hope it's obvious what a fire-breathing dragon can do, but if not, you'll figure it out.

# Class that represents 7 dwarves called Dwarf
# it will contain the attributes of :age, :name, :working(random boolean that states true or false if they are working or not)
# initialize each new Dwarf with these three attributes
# => (save this bit of code when I need it: -->random_boolean = [true, false].sample)
# => just create 7 different dwarves, make an array in driver code of each dwarves name
# => randomize age in driver code so each dwarves age will be different 

# 3 methods:

# method_one(argument)
# => input:
# => steps:
# => output:

# method_two is for hours_worked(argument of hours_integer)
# => input: integer
# => steps:
			# => take hours integer and multiply by 7
			# => PRINT the dwarf name and how many dwarf hours he worked today
# => output: string

# method_three
# => input:
# => steps:
# => output:
