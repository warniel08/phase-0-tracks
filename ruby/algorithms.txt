Robot on elevator algorithm pseudocode 

If entering elevator on first floor 
    Enter the elevator at least one foot inside
    Turn 180 degrees in place
    Extend right hand to the right all the way until it touches wall (Wall A)
    Hand should be 3 feet above floor (Floor)
    Elevator doors will close automatically
    Move hand forward along Wall A to where it intersects with wall (Wall B)
    Move hand left on Wall B 1 foot
The center of Floor 1 button position on Wall B is 3 ft above Floor and 1 ft to left of intersection of Walls A and B
Each button is a circle and has a diameter of 2 inches
There is one inch of wall space dividing each of the three floor buttons from each other
The center of Floor 2 button is 3 inches above center of Floor 1 button
The center of Floor 3 button is 3 inches above center of Floor 2 button
    If wanting to traverse to Floor 2
        While hand is at Floor 1 button location, move hand up 3 inches and extend pointer finger to depress Floor 2 button .25 inches
        Release pressure on button
            Once a button is pressed it will chime for .5 seconds to indicate it has been selected and it will light up and stay lit to confirm the selection
    Elsif wanting to traverse to Floor 3
        Repeat instructions for Floor 2 but move hand up 6 inches from Floor 1 button position
    End
Elsif entering elevator on second floor
    Follow same instructions for entering on first floor
    If wanting to traverse to Floor 1
        Depress Floor 1 button
    Elsif wanting to traverse to Floor 3
        Follow same instructions for traversing to Floor 3
    End
Elsif entering elevator on thrid floor
    Follow same instructions for entering on first floor

Real-Life Algorithm (Turn on light in family room)
Starting at back door doorknob, facing the door, and 38 inches to the left of 
back wall (Wall A), and 36 inches up from the floor
    Move up 11 inches from starting location and move 15 inches to the left of the
    starting location, the tip of the light switch is 3/8 of an inch perpendicular to the 
    wall (Wall B)
        This is the location of the light switch for the carport, we won't mess with
        this switch, this location should have the light switch in the off position
    Move left two inches and that switch is the light switch to the family room
        Move down 1/8 of an inch and in 3/8 of an inch toward Wall B
        Firmly push the light switch up 1 inch
            The light should now turn on (if bulbs are not burned out and power is not out)
