# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - Version control is a way for teams to collaborate on code and to keep the history incluing changes and deletions intact. Rather than creating different versions of your code and changing the name of the file each time or creating new files each time, version control keeps everything neat and orderly so that it can be searched and implemented very easily. Version control is useful because it is a way to back up your information without have to create backups every time you update your code. It keeps things orderly and easy to search. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch is a way for you to edit code and make all of the collaborations be individual and unique. There is the main branch which you don't want to work off of. After you have made a branch or several branches you will merge your changes from those branches into the main branch so everything is all together and plays nicely. It is easier to go back in the history of the branches and see what has been added and deleted to the code to make sure that things are working properly and to see if there is any code that needs to be addressed and fixed.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - A commit is a save that you make to your code. It takes a snapshot of the change at that moment in time. If there weren't any changes made a commit creates a link to that snapshot. 
    - A good commit message should be short and descriptive. A commit message help someone who's working on the code in the future understand why a particalur edit was made.
* What is a merge conflict?
    - A merge conflict happens when two people are editing the same bit of code or code file. If I change a bit of code and someone else deletes the same bit of code, there will be a conflict. Git will let you know and then you can go and change the code accordingly. Also, if someone were to delete a code file and someone else were working on that file, then there would be a merge conflict. It's important to identify merge conflicts so you can understand how to best resolve them to keep the code working well.
